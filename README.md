# IpadTimer / TabletTime
IpadTimer - Control iPad usage time and allow for a bonus system

## Project Description
Make a simple device that will allow a user (kids) to use an iPad for a certain amount of time during a day. When the ipad is in the box, the time is stopped. When the ipad is taken out, the timer is counting down. The timer device has an RFID reading buildin, so that bonus cards can be given out to get extra time. 

The project is is based on an ESP8266, a MFRC-522 RFID reader and an Adafruit 0.56" 4-Digit 7-Segment Display w/I2C Backpack. 

The software uses the notification service from IFTTT to send messenges to the iPad about how minutes are left, when the iPad needs to be returned and when bonus cards are being used  

In the Arduino code you can hardcode the cards you are using and what the default time per day of the week is.
