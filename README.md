IpadTimer - Control ipad usage time and allow for bonus system

## Project Description
Make a simple device that will allow a user (kids) to use an iPad for a certain amount of time during a day. When the ipad is in the box, the time is stopped. When the ipad is taken out, the timer is counting down. The timer device has an RFID reading buildin, so that bonus cards can be given out to get extra time.
